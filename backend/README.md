## System Architecture

The API acts as the central engine of the WaveTrack.AI platform. It receives an image from the frontend client, performs inference using the YOLOv5 model, processes the results, and returns a structured JSON response. This separation of concerns allows the frontend to remain lightweight and focused solely on user experience.



### API Functionality

The backend exposes a simple yet powerful set of endpoints:

-   `POST /predict/`: The core endpoint. It accepts an image file and returns a JSON object containing the number of detected vessels, their confidence scores, and a base64-encoded image with detection boxes drawn on it.
-   `GET /sample-images`: Provides a list of pre-loaded SAR image filenames that the frontend can use for demonstration purposes.

This architecture ensures that all heavy computational work is handled efficiently on the server, providing a smooth experience for the end-user.
